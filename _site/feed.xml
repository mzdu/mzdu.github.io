        <title>Business Table</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Next they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor&amp;rsquo;s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John Utterson. He looked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My head goes round,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;He has been all these days in possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor&amp;rsquo;s hand and dated at the top. &amp;ldquo;O Poole!&amp;rdquo; the lawyer cried, &amp;ldquo;he was alive and here this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he must be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how? and in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must be careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire catastrophe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

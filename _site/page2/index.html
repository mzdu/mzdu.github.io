      <h2><a href="">News from London</a></h2>
      <p>A daily journal by Edward Hyde.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <p>The far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre, which filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above, and by the cabinet, which formed an upper story at one end and looked upon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the by-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second flight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious cellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened.</p>

<p>The cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was Jekyll&rsquo;s predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance. No where was there any trace of Henry Jekyll dead or alive.</p>

      <h3><a href="/articles/wild-cold">Wild, Cold</a></h3>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <p>It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and flecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had never seen that part of <a href="http://google.com">London so deserted</a>.</p>

<p>He could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was borne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The square, when they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>But for all the hurry of his coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.</p>

      <h3><a href="/articles/search-for-mr-hyde">Search for Mr. Hyde</a></h3>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="twelve columns">
          <p>That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr.</p>

<p>Jekyll&rsquo;s Will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for Mr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his &ldquo;friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,&rdquo; but that in case of Dr. Jekyll&rsquo;s &ldquo;disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months,&rdquo; the said Edward Hyde should step into the said Henry Jekyll&rsquo;s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctor&rsquo;s household. This document had long been the lawyer&rsquo;s eyesore. It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest.</p>
